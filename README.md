# TDAuto
TDAuto is the start of an automated trading library that targets TD Ameritrade's APIs. These APIs allow users to check account information, stream real time data, execute trades, and much more. The goal of this library is to pair these resources with user defined algorithms to create fully automated trading strategies in the future.

Under Development:
 - Adding functionality to stream real time market data. Currently unable to recieve a response when logging into the streamer server. Working with TD Ameritrade's API developers on the issue. TD_API class is effected by this issue
