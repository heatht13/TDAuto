# TDAuto
TDAuto is the start of an automated trading library that targets TD Ameritrade's APIs. These APIs allow users to check account information, stream real time data, execute trades, and much more. The goal of this library is to pair these resources with user defined algorithms to create fully automated trading strategies in the future.
